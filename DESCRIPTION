Description: Aggregates or summarizes omics data into higher level functional 
            representations such as GO terms gene sets or KEGG metabolic 
            pathways, facilitating the analysis of functional molecular sets 
            that allow to reduce dimensionality and provide easier and faster 
            biological interpretations. Coordinated functional activity scores 
            can be as informative as single molecules!
